# ðŸ”¨ Projects
- [Film Gallery](https://github.com/ZhangAmyyy/film_gallery): 
This is a movie review website that allows users to search for movies and view detailed information, including plot summaries, cast, and user reviews. In terms of the technical implementation, we not only used traditional front-end frameworks but also incorporated external open-source APIs as our backend database. AWS services were employed for CRUD operations and page delivery. Ultimately, the application was containerized into a Docker image and deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine. Throughout the development process, we followed a CI/CD pipeline and utilized GitHub branch management to facilitate collaborative development across multiple environments.
